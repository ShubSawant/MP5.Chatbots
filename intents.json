       "There are 8 hostel blocks (D1 to D8) with a capacity to accommodate 738 students. In response to the recent trend of increasing number of girl students, two hostel blocks were suitably modified and converted into girls hostels. A total of 130 girl students are presently availing the facility of hostel accommodation. We intend to augment this by another 46 by the beginning of the next academic yearOn the initiative of our Chairman Shri Ajit Gulabchand, a hostel block with the capacity of 46 students was converted into a cyber hostel with internet connectivity. Students in the cyber hostel can bring their own computers for personal use. WCE is perhaps the first college in Maharashtra to create such facility for students. Cyber hostel has proved to be a useful and popular idea. We intend to extend internet connectivity to other hostels in a phased manner go to:http://walchandsangli.ac.in/docs/students/may17/Hostel_Fee_Rules_2017-18.pdf."
